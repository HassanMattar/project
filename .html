            <h2 id="headline">Programming languages development stages:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li> <span id=history>1883</span><span id="type">: Algorithm for the Analytical Engine</span> : Created by Ada Lovelace for Charles Babbage’s Analytical Engine to compute Bernoulli numbers, it’s considered to be the first computer programming language.</li>
                <li><span id=history>1949</span> <span id="type">: LAssembly Language</span>: First widely used in the Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator, assembly language is a type of low-level computer programming language that simplifies the language of machine code,
                     the specific instructions needed to tell the computer what to do.</li>
                   
                <li><span id=history>1952</span><span id="type">: Autocode</span>: Autocode was a generic term for a family of early computer programming languages. The first was developed by Alick Glennie for the Mark 1 computer at the University of Manchester in the U.K. Some consider autocode to be the first compiled computer programming language,
                     meaning that it can be translated directly into machine code using a program called a compiler.</li>
              <li><span id=history>1957</strong></span><span id="type">: Fortran</span> : A computer programming language created by John Backus for complicated scientific,
                     mathematical, and statistical work, Fortran stands for Formula Translation. It is the one of the oldest computer programming languages still used today.
                </li>
                <li><span id=history>1958</span> <span id="type">: Algol</span>: Created by a committee for scientific use, Algol stands for Algorithmic Language.
                     Algol served as a starting point in the development of languages such as Pascal, C, C++, and Java.</li>
                <li><span id=history>1959</span><span id="type">: COBOL</span> : Created by Dr. Grace Murray Hopper as a computer programming language that could run on all brands and types of computers, COBOL stands for COmmon Business Oriented Language. It is used in ATMs, credit card processing, telephone systems, hospital and government computers, automotive systems, and traffic signals.
                     In the movie The Terminator, pieces of COBOL source code were used in the Terminator’s vision display.</li>
                <li><span id=history>1959</span><span id="type">: LISP</span> : Created by John McCarthy of MIT, 
                    LISP is still in use. It stands for LISt Processing language.
                     It was originally created for artificial intelligence research but today can be used in situations where Ruby or Python are used.

                </li>
                <li><span id=history>1964</span><span id="type">: BASIC</span> : Developed by John G. Kemeny and Thomas E.
                     Kurtz at Dartmouth College so that students who did not have a strong technical or mathematical understanding could still use computers,
                     it stands for Beginner’s All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code. A modified version of BASIC was written by Bill Gates and Paul Allen. This was to become the first Microsoft product.

                    .</li>
            <li></time><strong> <span id=history>1970</span></strong><span id="type">: Pascal</span> : Developed by Niklaus Wirth, Pascal was named in honor of the French mathematician, physicist, and philosopher Blaise Pascal. It is easy to learn and was originally created as a tool for teaching computer programming. 
                    Pascal was the main language used for software development in Apple’s early years.
                    </li>
               
                <li><strong> <span id=history>1972</span></strong> <span id="type">: C</span>: Developed by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs, C is considered by many to be the first high-level language.
                     A high-level computer programming language is closer to human language and more removed from the machine code. 
                    C was created so that an operating system called Unix could be used on many different types of computers. 
                    It has influenced many other languages, including Ruby, C#, Go, Java, JavaScript, Perl, PHP, and Python.</li>
                <li><strong> <span id=history>1972</span></strong> <span id="type">: SQL</span>: SQL was developed by Donald D. Chamberlin and Raymond F.
                     Boyce at IBM. SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is used for viewing and changing information that is stored in databases.
                      SQL uses command sentences called queries to add, remove, or view data.
                     </li>
               
                <li><strong> <span id=history>1983</span></strong><span id="type">: C++</span>: C++ is an extension of the C language and was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup.
                     It is one of the most widely used languages in the world. C++ is used in game engines and high-performance software like Adobe Photoshop.
                      Most packaged software is still written in C++.

                </li>
                <li><strong> <span id=history>1991</span></strong><span id="type">: Python</span> : Designed by Guido Van Rossum, 
                    Python is easier to read and requires fewer lines of code than many other computer programming languages.
                     It was named after the British comedy group Monty Python. Popular sites like Instagram use frameworks that are written in Python.
                </li>
                <li><strong> <span id=history>1991</span></strong><span id="type">: Visual Basic</span> : Developed by Microsoft, Visual Basic allows programmers 
                    to choose and change pre-selected chunks of code in a drag-and-drop fashion through a graphical user interface (GUI).
                <li><strong> <span id=history>1995</span></strong><span id="type">: Java</span>: Originally called Oak, Java was developed by Sun Microsystems.
                     It was intended for cable boxes and hand-held devices but was later enhanced 
                     so it could be used to deliver information on the World Wide Web. Java is everywhere
                     , from computers to smartphones to parking meters.
                      Three billion devices run Java!
                </li>

                <li><strong> <span id=history>1995</span></strong> <span id="type">: JavaScript</span>: Created in just 10 days by Brendan Eich,
                     this language is mostly used to enhance many Web browser interactions. 
                    Almost every major website uses Javascript.

                </li>
                <li><strong> <span id=history>2000</span></strong>,<span id="type">: C#</span>: Developed by Microsoft with the goal of combining
                     the computing ability of C++ with the simplicity of Visual Basic, C# is based on C++ and is similar to Java in many aspects. 
                    It is used in almost all Microsoft products and is primarily used for developing desktop applications.</li>
                
                <li><strong> <span id=history>2014</span></strong> <span id="type">: Swift:</span> Developed by Apple as a replacement for C, C++, and Objective-C, Swift is supposed to be easier to use and allows less room for mistakes.
                     It is versatile and can be used for desktop and mobile apps and cloud services.
                           </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Most computer programming languages were inspired by or built upon concepts from previous computer programming languages.
                 Today, while older languages still serve as a strong foundation for new ones,
                  newer computer programming languages make programmers’ work simpler. Businesses rely heavily on programs to meet all of their data,
                   transaction, and customer service needs. Science and medicine need accurate and complex programs for their research.
                    Mobile applications must be updated to meet consumer demands.
                    And all of these new and growing needs ensure that computer programming languages,
                 both old and new, will remain an important part of modern life
